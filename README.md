# Generic Linked List Implementation in C

## Overview
This project implements a **generic linked list** in C, capable of handling multiple data types, including integers, strings, and characters. It provides utility functions for insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting, along with memory-efficient operations. The implementation is modular and extensible, making it easy to integrate into larger projects.

---

## Key Features
- **Type Flexibility**: Supports multiple data types such as integers, strings, and characters.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficiently manages memory for each node.
- **Customizable Comparisons**: Compare elements based on their type.
- **Rich Functionality**:
  - Adding elements to the front or back of the list.
  - Inserting elements at specific positions.
  - Searching for elements.
  - Sorting the list.
  - Reversing the list.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles edge cases like empty lists, null pointers, and out-of-bounds access gracefully.
- **Well-Documented API**: Comprehensive function descriptions and usage examples.

---

## Code Structure
The project includes the following core components:
1. **Node Definition**: Represents a linked list node containing `value` and `next` pointers.
2. **Linked List Structure**: Stores metadata, including list type, head pointer, and size.
3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `new_node`: Creates a new node with content.
   - `new_list`: Initializes a linked list of a specific type.
4. **Core Operations**:
   - `addFront`: Adds an element to the front.
   - `addBack`: Adds an element to the back.
   - `addAt`: Inserts an element at a specific position.
   - `insert_sorted`: Maintains order while inserting.
   - `reverse`: Reverses the entire list.

## Usage Instructions

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahesam2012/My_Projects.git
cd My_Projects
```

### Include in Your Project
Add `LinkedList.h` to your project directory and include it in your C program:
```c
#include "LinkedList.h"
```

### Initialize a Linked List
```c
LinkedList* list = new_list("int");
int value = 5;
addBack(&value, list);
```

### Perform Operations
- **Add elements**:
  ```c
  int value1 = 10, value2 = 15;
  addFront(&value1, list);
  addBack(&value2, list);
  ```

- **Search for an element**:
  ```c
  if (is_there(&value1, list)) {
      printf("Element found in the list.\n");
  }
  ```

- **Reverse the list**:
  ```c
  reverse(list);
  ```

### Run Tests
Use test cases to validate the implementation:
```c
int value3 = 20;
addAt(1, &value3, list);
void* element = get_at_index(1, list);
printf("Element at index 1: %d\n", *(int*)element);
```

---

## Example Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "LinkedList.h"

int main() {
    LinkedList* list = new_list("int");
    int val1 = 1, val2 = 2, val3 = 3;

    addBack(&val1, list);
    addBack(&val2, list);
    addBack(&val3, list);

    reverse(list);

    for (int i = 0; i < list->size; i++) {
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, *(int*)get_at_index(i, list));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
Element 0: 3
Element 1: 2
Element 2: 1
```
